# Java Trolley Car Ethics Assessment

## Overview
This project is the first part in a three part project. It is an ethical theory analyzer 
to assess what moral theory you base your decisions on. The end goal is to translate this into 
Kotlin and then make into a mobile app. 

For now, you can only run it through terminal. It presents you with 
different versions of the famous thought experiment, "The trolley car
problem". The user reads the scenarios and then must choose what they would
do and why. The software analyzes their decision and describes at the end
to the user by which theory they make their moral choices by.

## Development Environment
I used Intellij, since it was the best environment to use Java on.

## Future Work
I need to first finish the program by:
* fix the addScore function so that the score can be totaled
* code out the psuedocode for the hash map for the theory descriptions
* review the code to make sure it is clean, readable, and efficient

After I do all of these, I will move onto the next phase of the project,
which is to translate it to Kotlin and then make it into a mobile app.
